# Random Keys

### Mix and match different keys and variations to find the new sound you were looking for 

When you open the program all that you have to do is run it. When ran the program will give you a random chord in a random key that you can use to experiment with. 
The program gives the user one key at a time but can be modified to produce more.

### Future updates will be posted
